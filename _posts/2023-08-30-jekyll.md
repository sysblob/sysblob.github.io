# Introduction

I've spent a lot of time building websites. When I was wee youngster I remember the thrill of logging into free template providers like Geocities or Angelfire that made it so easy. I was 12 or 13 at the time and mostly just wanted a website with a cool flame.gif border. As I became older I got interested in learning the code behind websites and studied HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As my awareness of developing grew I got into web frameworks like Django, Flask, and React. Building websites is something I really do enjoy. I think that's why when I was introduced to the Github world of website building, I was excited to try another method of managing the whole process. Github brings a lot of organization to coding and websites are after all just more code -- why not manage them directly from Github?

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static website generator made by Github. Jekyll takes plain text and markdown and converts it into beautiful websites. It does this by rendering html from your markdown and combining that with what we call a **theme**.

Themes give your pages a layout such as a blog or a resume site. Themes typically come with config files that are easily edited to customize your website. Beyond that there are certain directories you can 'override' files such as css to suit your needs. Themes are based on Ruby gems and can be easily swapped out once you set Jekyll up. 

This website, for example, uses Jekyll to generate static content using the theme called Chirpy found here [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy).

## What is Github Pages?

Github Pages [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) was created with the idea of hosting a static website directly from your Github repository. Essentially as long as you have an index.html file at the base of your website directory you can push to github and host a website. Jekyll works great for this since you can write something like a blog post in plain text, mark it up with how you'd like it to look, generate the real website from that markdown, and upload it to Github. 

Does this interest you? Let's build this really cool pipeline.

## Setting up Jekyll with Chirpy theme

I'm still working on this portion of the guide. Check back soon sorry for the delay.

## Jekyll usage and tips

Here you will find some general guidelines on using Jekyll. For the most part Jekyll and Chirpy have great documentation so I will just be linking to them below. However, for some specific things I had to search a little harder for you can find those below as well.

Jekyll docs: [Jekyll page building](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/)  
Chirpy docs: [Chirpy formatting](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/)

### How do I link to another post?

You can link another post internally by referencing it like below:

{% raw %}
```liquid
[link name here]({% post_url 2023-09-02-postname %})
```
{% endraw %}

### Using codeblock around template language
Sometimes you will encounter wanting to codeblock something that liquid (the template renderer of Jekyll) wants to render. You can avoid this and still make a code block by using raw and endraw around the codeblock.
