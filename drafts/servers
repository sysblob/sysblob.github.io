Server racks are broken down into units called RU (Rack Units) - Most people refer to this just as U as in 6u or 18u. This is the height of the server.
1 U is the equivalent of 1.75 inches and items in the rack typically range from 1u to 3u with servers typically being 1u or 2u.
Server width is typically 19 inches. Most servers have an external width of 24 inches because most floor panels in server rooms are 24x24 which helps you effectively use your space.
Server depth varies per server but 24 and 48 inch depths are common. 24 Inch depth racks are ideal for network equipment while the common depth for server racks is 29 inches and this is compatible with most Dell, HP, and IBM servers.
